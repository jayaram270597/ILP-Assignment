   It will take a line as argument from the user, and display it in reverse order. If input string is null, error message should be given.
   If user enters less or more number of arguments, an error should be thrown

	Ex : 
	Input    : This is Unix.
	Output : Unix is This.

2) Use awk for displaying first n numbers in Fibonacci series where n is supplied as command line argument.
   Note: Fibonacci series of numbers are 0 and 1, and each remaining number is the sum of the previous two. 

3) Write a script that would print any one of the following message along with the username according to the system time:

   The input file should be given as command line argument.The script will check whether sufficient arguments are there or not and whether the argument is a file or not while the script is executed. 
   In case of invalid input, proper message should be displayed.
   NOTE: The output should display the word only once although it may occur in the file more than once. Total count should be also the count of the distinct words.
   e.g :-	If the content of the given file is as folows----------------
  		There are three bags.
  		This is a blue bag.
  		My blue bags are full.
